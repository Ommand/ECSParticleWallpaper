![alt asdasdasd](Res/gif1.gif "World map")

This repository contains a Unity project that converts a png image to a physics-based particle system, and implements high-performance render that uses GPU Instancing.

You can set the built package as a desktop wallpaper using the [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/)
